## Motivation
Paddle Serving helps deep learning developers deploy an online inference service without much effort. **The goal of this project**: once you have trained a deep neural nets with [Paddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle), you already have a model inference service. 

## Key Features
- Integrate with Paddle training pipeline seemlessly, most paddle models can be deployed **with one line command**.
- **Industrial serving features** supported, such as models management, online loading, online A/B testing etc.
- **Distributed Key-Value indexing** supported that is especially useful for large scale sparse features as model inputs.
- **Highly concurrent and efficient communication** between clients and servers.
- **Multiple programming languages** supported on client side, such as Golang, C++ and python
- **Extensible framework design** that can support model serving beyond Paddle.

## Installation

```shell
pip install paddle-serving-client
pip install paddle-serving-server
```

## Quick Start Example

``` shell
wget --no-check-certificate https://paddle-serving.bj.bcebos.com/uci_housing.tar.gz
tar -xzf uci_housing.tar.gz
python -m paddle_serving_server.serve --model uci_housing_model --thread 10 --port 9292
```

Python Client Request

``` python
from paddle_serving_client import Client

client = Client()
client.load_client_config("uci_housing_client/serving_client_conf.prototxt")
client.connect(["127.0.0.1:9292"])
data = [0.0137, -0.1136, 0.2553, -0.0692, 0.0582, -0.0727,
        -0.1583, -0.0584, 0.6283, 0.4919, 0.1856, 0.0795, -0.0332]
fetch_map = client.predict(feed={"x": data}, fetch=["price"])
print(fetch_map)

```
